## KryptoJobs2Go Integration into an Ethereum blockchain

### Background

KryptoJobs2Go is a unique business model still in the early days of it's infancy in the financial tech world. For this challenge, I am to take the task as the lead developer for the company. The shareholders are tasking me with: Intergrating the Ethereum blockchain, and verifying that customers are able to make payments instantly to the their corresponding FinTech professional that they are paying the services for.

### Prerequisites for Notebook:

You will need two main files in order to execute the task properly. The files are named: 'krypto_jobs.py', and "crypto_wallet.py" respectively. Both files are required because they do not complete the full functionality of the task at hand. The 'krypto_jobs.py' file is the file that is responsible for maintaining the code for the web interface part of the application. The other file 'crypto_wallet.py' however, does not contain any code other than the code that is responsible for containing the Ethereum transaction functions and records.

### Testing/Replication

To begin:
  - Navigate to the corresponding folder that contains both of the files required to complete challenge. Once you are in the directory, run the streamlit application. Note: You cannot run the streamlit application from anywhere else but the location that the specific file is located in the file explorer.
  - Once you have completed this, you can start using the application for live transactions.
  - Receipts and other transaction details are stored within Ganache.
